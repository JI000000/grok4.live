    ]
    
    # Each agent works on the problem independently
    solutions = []
    for agent in agents:
        solution = agent.solve(question)
        solutions.append(solution)
    
    # Consensus mechanism combines solutions
    final_answer = consensus_mechanism(solutions)
    return final_answer
```
