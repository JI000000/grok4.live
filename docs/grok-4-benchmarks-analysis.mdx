## üîç Technical Deep Dive

### The Multi-Agent Architecture

```python
class GrokHeavy:
    def __init__(self, agent_count=32):
        self.agents = [GrokAgent() for _ in range(agent_count)]
        self.coordinator = AgentCoordinator()
        
    def process_query(self, query):
        # Phase 1: Parallel processing
        agent_responses = []
        for agent in self.agents:
            response = agent.process(query)
            agent_responses.append(response)
        
        # Phase 2: Consensus building
        consensus = self.coordinator.synthesize(agent_responses)
        
        # Phase 3: Quality validation
        return self.validate_and_refine(consensus)
